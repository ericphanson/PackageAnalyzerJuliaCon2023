# PackageAnalyzerJuliaCon2023

[Some of the code (and data) demo'd at JuliaCon2023](https://github.com/ericphanson/PackageAnalyzerJuliaCon2023)

Here there are two notebooks:
* [`compare_to_general.jl`](./compare_to_general.jl). This notebook compares an individual package
  against all of General, with interactive widgets.
* [`analyze_manifest.jl`](./analyze_manifest.jl). This notebook presents an example analysis to understand the dependencies of an application.
